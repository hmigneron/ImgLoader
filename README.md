#ImgLoader.js

A simple way to pre-load images and get progress notification.

ImgLoader can load images from <img> tags, from CSS properties (through background-image) or simply images sent as parameters.

It can be used on its own when or along with a progress bar like [NProgress](https://github.com/rstacruz/nprogress) using the different callbacks to update the progress bar.

###Installation

ImgLoader needs jQuery >= 1.7 to operate. Add a reference to imgloader.min.js to your project.
